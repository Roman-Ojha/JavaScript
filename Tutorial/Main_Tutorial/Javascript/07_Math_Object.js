/*
    *) Math Object:
        -> The Math object allows we to perform mathematical tasks. 
        -> The Math object includes several mathematical constants and methods.
        -> Note: Math is not a constructor. All properties and methods of Math can be called by using Math as an object without creating it.

    *) Properties:
        • Math.E:
            -> Returns Euler's number (approx. 2.718)
        • Math.LN2:
            -> Returns the natural logarithm of 2 (approx. 0.693)
        • Math.LN10:
            -> Returns the natural logarithm of 10 (approx. 2.302)
        • Math.LOG2E:
            -> Returns the base-2 logarithm of E (approx. 1.442)
        • Math.LOG10E:
            -> Returns the base-10 logarithm of E (approx. 0.434)
        • Math.PI:
            -> Returns PI (approx. 3.14159)
        • Math.SQRT1_2:
            -> Returns the square root of 1/2 (approx. 0.707)
        • Math.SQRT2:
            -> Returns the square root of 2 (approx. 1.414)

    *) Methods:
        -> abs(x): Returns the absolute value of x
        -> ceil(x): Returns x, rounded upwards to the nearest integer
        -> floor(x): Returns x, rounded downwards to the nearest integer
        -> log(x): Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x
        -> max(x,y,z,...,n): Returns the number with the highest value
        -> min(x,y,z,...,n): Returns the number with the lowest value
        -> pow(x,y): Returns the value of x to the power of y
        -> sqrt(x): Returns the square root of x
        -> random( ): Returns a random number between 0 and 1
        -> round(x): Rounds x to the nearest integer
        -> sin(x): Returns the sine of x (x is in radians)
        -> cos(x): Returns the cosine of x (x is in radians)
        -> tan(x): Returns the tangent of an angle
